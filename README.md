# Scene40 Dataset
Scene40 is a medium-scale scene dataset which created based on the "VisualGenome" [https://visualgenome.org/] dataset.

Scene40 is a medium-scale scene dataset that includes indoor and outdoor scenes, and presented in our paper [doi]. The dataset contains 8538 images in 40 scene categories, whose scene labels were determined based on location (e.g., airport, park, etc.) or activity (e.g., horse riding, baseball game, etc.) in the image. Some scene categories are object-based and some of them are layout-based. The figure below shows the number of images in each category. In Scene40 dataset, a scene graph and a scene label are available corresponding to each scene image. In the scene graph corresponding to each scene image, objects have considered as vertices of the graph, and relations between the objects have considered as edges of the graph.
